LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell MOVIMENTO/dataRAM_reg[2]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous reset pin(s) MOVIMENTO/dataRAM_reg[0]/CLR, MOVIMENTO/dataRAM_reg[2]/CLR, MOVIMENTO/dataRAM_reg[1]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
